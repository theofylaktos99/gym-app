# Developer Review (based on the Gym App project)

## Technical Skills
- **Web Development**: You have very good knowledge of Flask and web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS).
- **Project Structure**: The structure is simple, clean, and functional, suitable for demo/educational projects.
- **Multilingual Support**: You have correctly implemented multilingualism in both UI and data.
- **Automation**: You provide scripts for easy startup and installation, showing care for user experience.
- **Documentation**: The documentation is complete and understandable, which shows professionalism.

## Soft Skills
- **Focus on Usability**: The application is easy to use and install.
- **Educational Approach**: The choice for simplicity and clarity shows a willingness to help others learn.
- **Organization**: The documentation and folder structure show organizational thinking.

## Points for Improvement
- **Modularity/Scalability**: For larger projects, it would be good to split the logic into modules and use a database.
- **Security**: Security is essential for production apps. Here it is simplified (logical for a demo).
- **Testing**: There are no automated tests, which would raise the level of the project.

## Overall Impression
You have very good foundations as a developer, with emphasis on practicality, documentation, and user experience. If you continue to work on more modular, scalable, and secure projects, you will evolve even further.

**Score (for demo/educational project level): 8.5/10**
