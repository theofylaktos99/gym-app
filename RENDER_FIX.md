# Render Deployment Fix

## Issue
The Render deployment was failing with:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'gym_app'
```

## Root Cause
The Render service was configured with an incorrect start command. It was trying to run:
```bash
gunicorn gym_app:app
```

But the application entry point is `run.py`, not `gym_app.py`.

## Solution

### Option 1: Update Start Command in Render Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to your service in the Render dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** tab
3. Find the **Start Command** field
4. Update it to:
   ```bash
   gunicorn run:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 4 --timeout 120
   ```
5. Save changes
6. Trigger a manual deploy or wait for auto-deploy

### Option 2: Use Blueprint Deployment
If you haven't already, deploy using Render's Blueprint feature:
1. Delete the existing service
2. Click **"New +"** â†’ **"Blueprint"**
3. Select this repository
4. Render will automatically read `render.yaml` which has the correct configuration

## Files Changed
- **Procfile** (new): Added as a fallback configuration file that Render can use
- **RENDER_DEPLOY.md**: Updated with troubleshooting information about this issue
- **render.yaml**: Already had correct configuration (no changes needed)

## Verification
After deploying with the correct start command, the application should start successfully. You can verify by:
1. Checking the logs in Render dashboard - should see Gunicorn workers starting
2. Accessing your app URL - should load without errors
3. Testing login with demo credentials

## Application Entry Point
- **File**: `run.py`
- **App object**: `app`
- **Correct import**: `from run import app` or `run:app` (for Gunicorn)

The old `gym_app.py` was a legacy monolithic version that has been refactored into the current modular structure.
